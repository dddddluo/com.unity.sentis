# Sentis overview

Sentis is a neural network inference library for Unity. The package is in a "pre-release" state in an open beta program available to all Unity users via the [package manager](https://tinyurl.com/4eun48fb). The features and documentation may change before it is verified for release near the end of 2024. If you would like to release a commercial project with Sentis before it is released, please reach out to [bill.cullen@unity3d.com](mailto:bill.cullen@unity3d.com).

For additional information, updates from our team, and collaboration opportunities with other beta users, visit the [Unity Discussions Sentis topic](https://discussions.unity.com/c/10). If you have an interesting project that you would like to collaborate on with Unity, complete and submit [this form](https://create.unity.com/sentis-project-submission) and we'll be excited to speak with you.

You can use Sentis to import trained neural network models into Unity, and then run them in real-time locally on any runtime platform that Unity supports. Models can be deployed on either the GPU or the CPU.

To use Sentis, it helps if you have some experience in using machine learning models, for example in a framework like [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) or [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/).

|Section|Description|
|-|-|
|[Get started](get-started.md)|Install Sentis, find and use sample projects, and understand the Sentis workflow.|
|[Create a model](create-a-model.md)|Create a runtime model by importing an ONNX model file or using the Sentis model API.|
|[Run a model](run-an-imported-model.md)|Create input data for a model, create an engine to run the model, and get output.|
|[Use Tensors](use-tensors.md)|Get, set and modify input and output data.|
|[Profile a model](profile-a-model.md)|Use Unity tools to profile the speed and performance of a model.|

## Supported platforms

Sentis supports [all the platforms Unity supports](https://docs.unity3d.com/Documentation/Manual/PlatformSpecific.html).

The runtime of a model varies based on factors such as its complexity, the platform it runs on, and the type of engine you use. Refer to [Models](models-concept.md) and [Create an engine](create-an-engine.md) for more information.

## Supported model types

Sentis supports most models in Open Neural Network Exchange (ONNX) format with an [opset version](https://github.com/onnx/onnx/blob/main/docs/Versioning.md#released-versions) between 7 and 15. Refer to [Supported models](supported-models.md) and [Supported ONNX operators](supported-operators.md) for more information.
